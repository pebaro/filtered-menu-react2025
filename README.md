# FILTERED MENU
This is a lightweight solution that gives the user a virtually instant experience when filtering

## The Structure
There is a very simple structure and is made up of the following:

- App.jsx (root)
  - Categories.jsx (components)
  - Menu.jsx (components)
  - MenuItem.jsx (components)
  - Title.jsx (components)

The other files are also located in the root of the directory apart from the images which although not the best decision they are located in the public folder. Locating the images here is just because this component is the development version and not yet part of the project that it will be integrated with.
